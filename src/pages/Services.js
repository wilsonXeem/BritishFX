          The FX market is made up of many different counterparts - central
          banks, banks, investment firms, commercial companies, hedge funds and
          investors. The large, international banks are, however, the main
          participants of the market. The foreign exchange market may appear to
          be a daunting and confusing subject, however it doesn't need to be.
          We've put together a team to try and help you better understand the FX
          market - the key currencies that exist, a full of industry terms, a
          section on some key terms, investment strategies and other information
          about the market.
