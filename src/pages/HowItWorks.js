        BritishFX offer total transparency and accountability compared to a typical fund. <br />
        <br />
        With a BritishFX account your funds are held by you and only you, as
        opposed to a typical fund where your money is held by the fund manager
        and that places you in a vulnerable position. <br />
        <br />
        A forex secured account protects you, as you would retain complete
        control of your funds in an FSA regulated brokerage. <br />
        <br />
        You are the only person that would have access to your funds and the
        only person who can withdraw these funds. <br />
        <br />
        You will be able to view all live trades as they happen via a well-known
        industry standard trading platform called an MT4.
